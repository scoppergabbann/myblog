**SIPD-RI Helper** is a Python-based command-line application that automates tasks on the [SIPD-RI](https://sipd.kemendagri.go.id/landing) web application. It helps reduce human error and saves time by automating browser interactions using Playwright.

<Alert type="important" title="So...">

I decided to continue the project in a private repository because it contains many secrets and internal-only features that should not be public.

Also, most users of SIPD-RI (the target of this automation) do not code and do not use English, so maintaining a public codebase here is not useful for them.

## Features

- Retry mechanism for unstable elements (e.g. 404 errors, missing dropdowns)
- CLI interface and readable logging
- Modular structure, easy to tweak or extend for future automation needs
- Can be compiled into `.exe` for use on Windows without Python
