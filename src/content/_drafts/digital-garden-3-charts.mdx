I've added support to create charts using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org) for data visualization. These are some of the examples:

## Line Chart

Line charts are great for showing trends over time or continuous data. For example, this could be used to show website traffic growth, stock prices, or temperature changes across a week.

## Bar Chart

Bar charts are useful for comparing categories side by side. They highlight differences in scale and are often easier to interpret at a glance.

## Pie Chart

Pie charts show proportions of a whole. A simple example would be showing market share percentages, or the distribution of tasks within a project.
