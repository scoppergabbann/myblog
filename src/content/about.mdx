My name is **Odhy Pradhana**. I like creating simple, useful apps, building websites for fun, and telling stories with charts. I work full-time as an accountant, and spend much of my free time coding.

I write to share what I learn and build, like working with the garage door open. It helps me trace where I've been and how I got here. It's part reference, part reflection.

Outside of that, I love quiet walks in nature, visiting beaches, and spending time with my wife and our two cats.

This site is my corner of the web, but I'd love for it to be a conversation. If you want to share an idea, talk about something I've written, or just say hello, you can reach me at [hello@odhyp.com](mailto:hello@odhyp.com).
