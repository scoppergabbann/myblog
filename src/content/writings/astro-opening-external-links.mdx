Astro doesn't offer a built-in integration specifically for automatically opening external links in new tabs, but we can easily implement it using a Markdown (or MDX) plugin. This runs at build time, giving you a clean, dependency-free solution.

[Astro's docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#adding-remark-and-rehype-plugins) recommend using [rehype-external-links](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-external-links) as your go-to plugin for external link behavior in Markdown content.

## Install plugin

To install `rehype-external-links`, run the following command in a Node.js (version 16+) environment:

```bash
npm install rehype-external-links
```

## Apply plugin

In your `astro.config.mjs`, import `rehype-external-links`. You can set your own `target` or `rel`.

```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={1,5-15}
import rehypeExternalLinks from "rehype-external-links";

export default defineConfig({
  ...
  markdown: {
    rehypePlugins: [
      [
        rehypeExternalLinks,
        {
          target: "\_blank",
          rel: ["noopener", "noreferrer", "external"],
        },
      ],
    ],
  },
  ...
});
```

## Output

```html {3-4}
<a
  href="https://github.com/odhyp/"
  rel="noopener noreferrer external"
  target="_blank"
>
  GitHub
</a>
```

The `target` and `rel` will be added to every external anchor tag after `npm run build` (or `npm run dev`).
