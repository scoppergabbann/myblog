## Comments

- This site uses [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) for comments and discussions.
- Giscus runs on **GitHub Discussions**, so posting a comment requires a GitHub account. Your comments will appear publicly on GitHub.
- Comments are not stored on this site. They’re managed entirely by GitHub in this [repository’s discussions](https://github.com/odhyp/odhyp/discussions).

## Analytics

- I use **Cloudflare Analytics** and **Google Analytics** to understand site performance and visitor trends (e.g., page views, device types, and general locations).
- This data is aggregated and does not personally identify you.

## No Ads or Trackers

This site does **not**:

- Show ads
- Use tracking pixels
- Sell or share your data
- Collect unnecessary personal information

## Your Privacy, Your Control

You can browse the site freely without logging in or providing personal details. Any interaction beyond reading (like leaving a comment) is entirely optional.
